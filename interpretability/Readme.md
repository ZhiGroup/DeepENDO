# Code files for generating interpretability for the endophenotype.

## The basic principle behind interpretability of a particular endophenotype is to perturb the particular endophenotype by adding noise and identifying corresponding changes over the MRI. 

### Code walkthrough

- dataset.py : custom pytorch dataset
- model.py: contains the model
- interpretability_T1.ipynb: contains the interpretability visualization for T1.
- interpretability_T2.ipynb: contains the interpretability visualization for T2.
